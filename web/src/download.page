h1. Windows

In order to run the pre-compiled binaries we provide for Windows, you need

* "Qt/Windows Open Source Edition >= 4.3.0":http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows
* "Python >= 2.4":http://www.python.org/download/
* "SIP >= 4.7":http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/download.php
* "PyQt4 >= 4.3":http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

Get the file "scidavis-x.y.z-windows.zip" from
"here":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=236207,
open it and copy (unzip) the content to some convenient location.
Finally, start SciDAVis by double-clicking on scidavis.exe.
If you want a link on your desktop and/or start menu, you currently have to create it manually
(by dragging the scidavis executable to the desired destination).

Also, the manual is not included due to its size and our intention to update it in between releases.
If you want to install it, get it
"here":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=241381
(you only need the zip file) and unpack it like the binaries.
You can view it either from the Help menu in SciDAVis or by opening the file "index.html" in your browser.

We're looking for someone with the necessary know-how to create a graphical installer.

h1. Linux

h2. SUSE

Thanks to Quentin Denis, packages of the application as well as the manual are available
"here":http://packman.links2linux.org/package/scidavis.

h2. Debian

Thanks to Burkhard Bunk, packages for Debian Etch are available
"here":http://debian.physik.hu-berlin.de.

h2. Other distributions

For all distributions that don't have specific packages yet, we offer a universal binary.
You need to install the following dependencies, either from your package manager or by following the links below:

* "Qt >= 4.3.0":http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/x11
* "Python >= 2.4":http://www.python.org/download/
* "SIP >= 4.7":http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/download.php
* "PyQt4 >= 4.3":http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

Get scidavis-x.y.z-linux.tar.bz2 from
"here":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=236207.
If you don't know how to open this file, start a terminal, cd to the directory containing it and enter

{hlblock: {blockName: linux, highlight: plaintext}}

This will create a directory "scidavis-x.y.z" with the binary and some additional files.

h1. MacOS X

Currently, we do not have anyone to test SciDAVis on MacOS X or provide pre-compiled binaries.
The sources should compile though (please tell us if they don't).
Any help in this area will be greatly appreciated.

h1. Source tarballs

Even though the INSTALL.html file included in the source tarballs contains pretty detailled instructions for
compiling SciDAVis, this is more difficult than installing pre-compiled packages.
If you've never compiled an application before, you'll probably spend some time figuring out how to install
all the dependencies (including development packages).
You have been warned.

That said, you can get the sources either as .tar.bz2 or .zip archive
"here":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=236207.

h1. The bleeding edge (subversion repository)

You only need to get this if you want to participate in developing SciDAVis or test the things we are
currently working on (which is to say, they are generally unfinished and not suitable for normal usage).

To check out the development version, you need a "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org
client.
Here's how to do it using the command-line client:

{hlblock: {blockName: svnco, highlight: plaintext}}

After that, you proceed as with the source tarballs.

--- svnco, html
svn co https://scidavis.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scidavis/trunk scidavis

--- linux, html
tar xjvf scidavis-x.y.z-linux.tar.bz2
