=== Release 0.2.0-beta1, 2008-08-10 ===
Most important changes (since 0.1.3)
- multi-level undo/redo for all operations on
  tables and matrices
- many operations on tables and matrices now support
  non-contiguous selections
- the important options/controls for matrices
  and tables are now integrated in a sidebar
  of control tabs which make working with
  column or matrix based data much more
  convenient (almost no more opening and closing of
  dialogs necessary)
- tables now support different formulas
  for each cell
- numeric values are now stored independent of
  their textual representation, i.e., you don't
  lose data when hiding decimal digits
- date/time values are now internally stored
  as QDateTime objects which opens up many
  new possibilities of date/time manipulation 
  using PyQt/Python scripting

Known issues (to be fixed until 0.2.0 stable):
- the Python bindings for the new table
  features are not finished yet
- there is currently no way to display which
  formula has been assigned to which cell
  in a table
- the date/time column functionality has
  not been completely integrated and may
  lead to empty plots in many cases
