h1. SciDAVis lives from your contributions

This project is entirely run by means of voluntary contributions people make in their spare time.
Since all project-related resources are hosted by <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</a>
free of charge and membership is also free, the only investment we make and we ask you
to make if you're using SciDAVis is some time.

There's many good reasons for contributing, including:
* Adapting SciDAVis to your needs without having to port your changes to new versions.
* You make sure that the software you're using will continue to be improved and maintained.
  The more people contribute, the less likely it is that the project will be abandoned.
* You can influence (through words and actions) the direction the project is taking.
* The dicision what, when and how much to contribute is up to you, so you could actually
  have some fun along the way (we certainly do :-)). Before you start, you should
  announce your plans on
  "scidavis-contributors":https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scidavis-contributors
  though, so we're not doing the same work twice and to see how your ideas fit in with
  everybody else's plans.
* Particularly if you're using a lot of free software, you can see it as a chance to give
  something back to the community at large.
* You can acquire skills that might be useful for your job, on the technical as well as
  on the social side (hard and soft skills).

h1. Yes, yes, I'd like to - but how?

There's many ways in which you
can contribute, and only one or two of them require any programming
knowledge. Depending on your skills and the amount of time you are
willing to invest, you can provide help on the
"forum":https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=708156, improve
or write documentation,
"report bugs":http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=199120&atid=968214,
"suggest features":http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=199120&atid=968217,
translate SciDAVis into a new language or update an existing translation, package SciDAVis for your
favorite distribution or platform, write new features, create artwork
(icons, splash screen, mascot), etc., etc.

Some of the above require additional explanations to get you started.
Please see the submenu to the left for available documents.
We plan to expand these pages in the future, in order to better help you to help us. :-)
