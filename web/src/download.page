You can get the source tarball or precompiled binaries for Linux and Windows on our
"Sourcefore.net download page":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=236207.
Optionally, you can also download the manual or updated translations.

Thanks to Quentin Denis, there are
"packages for openSUSE 10.2":http://packman.links2linux.org/package/scidavis.

We're looking for people willing to contribute packages for more Linux distributions, MacOS X and maybe a graphical
Windows installer, as well as translators for updating existing and contributing new translations.

You can also check out the development version using "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org.
Here's how to do it:

{hlblock: {blockName: svnco, highlight: plaintext}}

Instructions for compiling can be found in the file "INSTALL.html" included with the source.

You might also be interested in our "roadmap":about/roadmap.html.
