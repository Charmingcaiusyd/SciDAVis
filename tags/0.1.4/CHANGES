Most important changes (since 0.1.3)

- Weighted linear and polynomial fits required actual weights
 (1/sigma^2) to be specified in place of standard errors, while all others
 (as well as error bar plots) needed the standard errors themselves.
 Solution:  Switched everything to using standard errors, eliminating the term
				"weighting" from the GUI and most of the source code.
 Rationale: Avoid confusion for users, especially given the previous
				inconsistent treatment of the matter. Avoid confusion for
				devs. Arbitrary weights don't work naturally with non-linear fits;
				and they almost certainly lead to nonsensical error estimates of
				results (unless you _really_ know what you're doing, in which case
				you can simply specify 1/sqrt(weight) as standard error).

- Fixed estimation of parameter errors in case of non-linear fitting with
  unknown Y errors.

- Fixed computation of R^2 in case of known Y errors.

- Fixed handling of parameters in fit curve formulas as well as constant
  fit parameters; both of which used naive string-substitution; i.e. if
  you used parameter names which appeared elsewhere as substrings of other
  parameter names or functions, you'd get weird errors. Unfortunately, the fix
  makes non-linear fitting with user-supplied formulas a bit slower; hopefully,
  we'll come up with a Really Good Solution(tm) for one of the next major
  releases.

- Fixed problem with FFT filters which could lead to incorrect results:
  Cutoffs could fall between real and imaginary part of a Fourier component,
  producing a reduced amplitude and bogus phase at this point.

- Fixed crash when creating bargraph with errorbars.

- New Russian translation by f0ma.

- Ported the hack that prevents axes gaps in graph vector exports
  (eps, pdf, svg) from QtiPlot.

- Numerous small tweaks and bug fixes.
