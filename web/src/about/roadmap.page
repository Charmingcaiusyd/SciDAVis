h1(#policy). Release Policy

Release numbers will follow the scheme major.minor.bugfix.

"major" releases differ considerably in architectur and potentially break backwards-compatibilty,
particularly with respect to plugins. Therefore, they will occur only very infrequently.

"minor" releases add some new functionality, but do not change existing interfaces or otherwise
break other people's code. If they do, that's a bug and, obviously, we're trying to avoid bugs. :-)

As the name suggests, "bugfix" releases fix bugs in the previous minor release, but do not add
new functionality, so they're unlikely to introduce new bugs.

In addition to the latest and greatest release with the newest features, we'll support a "stable"
line of bugfix releases for the last-but-one minor release.
In the following, only x.y.0 releases are discussed. Concurrently to the development of the
next feature release, bugs we get to know about will be fixed and, depending on their
number and severity, bugfix releases (x.y.z) will be provided.

h1(#0.1.0). 0.1.0: Improved user interface and fixes to project file loading

Starting point is the QtiPlot codebase somewhere between 0.9-rc2 and 0.9 (Subversion
revision 621, to be precise).

The goal of this release is to improve some aspects of the user interface so that prospective
users and contributors can see where we're going. For example, a few unnecessarily complicated
menus like "Analysis" and dialogs like those for graph settings will be cleaned up.
Also, some bugs have to be fixed; particularly in the area of loading project files.

<b>Released 2007-08-05</b><br>
Most important changes (since QtiPlot 0.9-rc2):
* improved handling of custom decimal separators
* many improvements/additions to Python scripting
* improved user interface: restructured menus and tool bars, several restructured dialogs
* script window removed since notes offer the same capabilities
* more stable project loading/saving
* easier ASCII import/export, improved appending of projects and Origin graphs
* lots of small improvements and bug fixes
* export to eps and pdf without large white borders


h1(#0.2.0). 0.2.0: Parts of 1.0.0 (?)

Many of the features planned for 1.0.0 are interdependent, which is why so many large-scale changes
are scheduled for one release.
However, if it will turn out to be viable, we'll release one or more versions with a subset of these
features. Possibly a version with multi-level undo/redo for tables only.

h1(#1.0.0). 1.0.0: Internal reorganizations, undo, plugins

Most notably for users, this release will feature multi-level undo/redo
for changes to tables, matrices and notes; possibly also for graphs.
Due to the complexity and pending changes in 1.1.0, it might prove necessary
to postpone undo of graphs, but this definitely also is something we'd like to have.

SciDAVis 1.0.0 will be extensible with custom functionality by writing
plugins in C++; using a flexible data analysis
architecture based on the column-based abstraction of a typed data source and
filters modelled on integrated electronic circuits (in the sense that they are a "black box"
with a number of input and output ports).
The plugin system will be very generic at its core, but probably not all functionality
will be added in this release. Particularly, implementing new plot/curve types
will be influenced by the changes planned for version 1.1.0, so these parts will
probably be postponed until 1.1.0.

Furthermore, several of the core classes will be split into smaller ones or completely
rewritten, following the Model/View/Controller approach. This is necessary to integrate a sufficiently
flexible plugin interface, but also to ensure longterm-maintainability of the code.
Particularly, internal APIs relying on undocumented string formats will be eliminated
in favour of the data source abstraction.
For users, this will hopefully mean that we can drop many of the existing restrictions on aspect and
column names.

A new, completely XML-based file format will be introduced, allowing us to use existing
parsers and validity checkers, almost certainly improving reliability of project file opening and saving.
Loading files in the legacy format will continue to be supported.

The classes will be reorganized into a number of modules in order to improve code readability
and maintainability.
Modules will reside in separate directories and compile separately, but most if not all of
the current functionality will remain part of the main executable.

h1(#1.1.0). 1.1.0: New visualisation engine

The Qwt library will be replaced by a new engine based on Qt's GraphicsView framework,
allowing, among other benefits, the use of floating-point linewidths, support for
polar and ternary plots and plots with broken axes.
Seeing that this will be a major task in its own right, we can only hope that it will
be possible without invalidating changes done in 1.0.0.

It may be necessary to delay large parts of the plugin interface until 1.1.0 in order
to be able to guarantee backwards-compatibility between 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.

h1(#1.2.0). 1.2.0: Features facilitated by the 1.0.0/1.1.0 architecture

The integration of Python will be completed by removing the last muParser-specific parts.
It will be possible to use Python's global variables and functions everywhere, e.g. for function
plotting.

Add more demo plugins and tutorials, encourage users to contribute plugins for inclusion into
future versions and/or to a central plugin database.

Add polar and ternary plots to the new engine, if not already done in 1.1.0.

Lots of other features like baseline-detection, import/export filters for OpenDocument spreadsheets,
waterfall plots etc. Probably not all of them in 1.2.0.

The crystal ball becomes really fuzzy from this point on.
Que sera, sera. ;-)
