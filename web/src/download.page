h1. Windows

Thanks to Mauricio Troviano, we have an installer for Windows.

The installer contains the necessary Qt dlls, is able to download and install Python 
and PyQt. The manual is not included due to its
size and our intention to update it in between releases.
Note: The installer is designed for 32bit Windows. It is reported to run on 64bit Windows as well
as long as the 32bit version of Python is installed.

That said, all necessary links and files can be found
"here":http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=199120&sel_platform=8193.

h1. Linux

SciDAVis is distributed as part of a growing number of Linux distributions, including the following:
* "Fedora":http://fedoraproject.org/
* "Mandriva":http://www.mandriva.com/
* "Debian":http://www.debian.org (squeeze and sid, not in the stable version yet)
* "Ubuntu":http://www.ubuntu.com (starting with 10.04, Lucid Lynx)
* "PCLinuxOS":http://pclinuxos.com/
* "Zenwalk":http://www.zenwalk.org (snapshot tree, not in the stable version yet)

For other distributions, third-party resources exist such as
* the "Arch Linux package on the AUR":http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=19201
* a "Slackware package":http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~fellypen/progs/scidavis/
* the (unfortunately outdated) "openSUSE packages on PackMan":http://packman.links2linux.org/package/scidavis

If your favourite distribution doesn't contain a package yet, or it is outdated, there are usually
ways to request one or roll your own (see the documentation/homepage of the distribution in
question).

Alternatively, we offer a universal binary with most dependencies statically linked in. Note that
this approach doesn't integrate as well with the system as a dedicated package, nor can it be
guaranteed to work in every case. Information about dependencies and installation instructions can
be found
"here":http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=199120&sel_platform=13808.
If you don't know how to open scidavis-x.y.z-x86-linux-qt4.4-py2.5.tar.bz2: Start a terminal, cd to
the directory containing it and enter
{coderay:: {lang: plaintext, line_numbers: false}} tar xjvf scidavis-x.y.z-x86-linux-qt4.4-py2.5.tar.bz2 {coderay}
This will create a directory "scidavis-x.y.z-x86-linux" with the binary and some additional files.

h1. MacOS X

Thanks to Yu-Hung Lien, we can offer you MacOS X binaries of SciDAVis.
A Mac OS X binary of the latest stable version is made available 
"here":https://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=199120&sel_platform=8143 shortly after each release. 

Binaries of the unstable version can be found "here":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=287353.

Special note for compiling SciDAVis 0.1.2: before compiling you need to edit scidavis/scidavis.pro and replace every occurence of "LIBS +=
-L /some/directory" with "LIBS += -L/some/directory" (remove the space character). This is fixed in SciDAVis 0.1.3.

h1. Source tarballs

Even though the INSTALL.html file included in the source tarballs contains pretty detailled instructions for
compiling SciDAVis, this is more difficult than installing pre-compiled packages.
If you've never compiled an application before, you'll probably spend some time figuring out how to install
all the dependencies (including development packages).
You have been warned.

That said, you can get the sources either as .tar.bz2 or .zip archive
"here":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=236207.

h1. Unstable releases

Before we release a new stable version with many new features, we usually release beta versions in the
hope that many people test them an report bugs. These development versions are available 
"here":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=287353.

h1. The bleeding edge (subversion repository)

You only need to get this if you want to participate in developing SciDAVis or test the things we are
currently working on (which is to say, they are generally unfinished and not suitable for normal usage).

To check out the code in development, you need a "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org
client.
The latest stable code can be obtained as follows:

{coderay:: {lang: plaintext, line_numbers: false}} svn checkout https://scidavis.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scidavis/branches/current_stable scidavis {coderay}

The code of the development version (possibly very unstable) can be obtained from LabPlot's repository,
where we're working on a common code base:

{coderay:: {lang: plaintext, line_numbers: false}} svn checkout https://labplot.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/labplot/2.0 scidavis {coderay}

At times the development of certain features may be taking place in other branches. Contact the 
developers about this.

If you are interested in the development version, we highly recommend contacting us
on the scidavis-contributers mailing list.

After the svn checkout, you proceed as with the source tarballs.
