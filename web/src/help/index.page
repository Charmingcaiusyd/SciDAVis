h1. What can you find here?

This page aims to give you an overview of where you can find help on using SciDAVis.
It does not contain help related to contributing to or developing SciDAVis, which
is "here":contributing/index.html.

h1. The manual

The first place to go if you want to get started or have questions concerning the usage of SciDAVis
is the "user's manual":manual/index.html.
It explains everything from basic techniques over menus and dialogs to advanced usage.

h1. The help forum

No manual can possible answer all of your questions. Maybe you can't even find an ansatz for what to
try or where in the manual to search, or something doesn't work like you'd expect it to but you're
not 100% sure it's a bug.
For these cases, we have the "Help & Tips":https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=708156
forum, where users can help each other with their problems.
Since we're using SciDAVis too, you can expect us to drop by now and then. :)

h1. The user's mailing list

Some people prefer using email for discussions, so we're offering a
"user's mailing list":https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scidavis-users
where you can ask questions, share your insights and just discuss anything related to using SciDAVis.
By subscribing to this list, you also get the chance to learn from other people's questions and
discussions.
