h1. Windows

Thanks to Mauricio Troviano, we have an installer for Windows.

The installer contains the necessary Qt dlls, is able to download and install Python 
and provides a binary version of PyQt that works with SciDAVis. The manual is not included due to its
size and our intention to update it in between releases. Likewise, translations currently have to be
installed seperately. Future releases of the installer may be extended to handle these things.

That said, all necessary links and files can be found
"here":http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=199120&sel_platform=7767.

h1. Linux

h2. SUSE

Thanks to Quentin Denis, packages of the application as well as the manual are available
"here":http://packman.links2linux.org/package/scidavis.

h2. Debian

Thanks to Burkhard Bunk, packages for Debian Etch are available
"here":http://debian.physik.hu-berlin.de.

h2. Other distributions

For all distributions that don't have specific packages yet, we offer a universal binary.
You need to install the following dependencies, either from your package manager or by following the links below:

* "Qt >= 4.3.0":http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/x11
* "Python >= 2.4":http://www.python.org/download/
* "SIP >= 4.7":http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/download.php
* "PyQt4 >= 4.3":http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

Get scidavis-x.y.z-linux.tar.bz2 from
"here":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=236207.
If you don't know how to open this file, start a terminal, cd to the directory containing it and enter

{hlblock: {blockName: linux, highlight: plaintext}}

This will create a directory "scidavis-x.y.z" with the binary and some additional files.

h1. MacOS X

As of SciDAVis 0.1.2, you need to edit scidavis/scidavis.pro and replace every occurence of "LIBS +=
-L /some/directory" with "LIBS += -L/some/directory" (remove the space character). This is fixed in SciDAVis 0.1.3.

Currently, we do not have anyone to test SciDAVis on MacOS X or provide pre-compiled binaries.
Any help in this area will be greatly appreciated.

h1. Source tarballs

Even though the INSTALL.html file included in the source tarballs contains pretty detailled instructions for
compiling SciDAVis, this is more difficult than installing pre-compiled packages.
If you've never compiled an application before, you'll probably spend some time figuring out how to install
all the dependencies (including development packages).
You have been warned.

That said, you can get the sources either as .tar.bz2 or .zip archive
"here":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199120&package_id=236207.

h1. The bleeding edge (subversion repository)

You only need to get this if you want to participate in developing SciDAVis or test the things we are
currently working on (which is to say, they are generally unfinished and not suitable for normal usage).

To check out the code in development, you need a "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org
client.
The latest stable code can be obtained as follows:

{hlblock: {blockName: svncostable, highlight: plaintext}}

The code of the unstable version (possibly very unstable) can be obtained from the so-called
'trunk' where the newest features are developed:

{hlblock: {blockName: svnco, highlight: plaintext}}

If you are interested in the development version, we highly recommend contacting us
on the scidavis-contributers mailing list.

After the svn checkout, you proceed as with the source tarballs.
