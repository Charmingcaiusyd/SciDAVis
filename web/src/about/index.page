h1. Mission Statement

SciDAVis is a free interactive application aimed at data analysis and
publication-quality plotting. It combines a shallow learning curve and
an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface with powerful
features such as scriptability and extensibility. SciDAVis runs on
GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS X; possibly also on other platforms like
*BSD, although this is untested.

SciDAVis is similar in its field of application to proprietary Windows
applications like "Origin":http://www.originlab.com and
"SigmaPlot":http://www.systat.com/products/SigmaPlot as well as free applications
like "QtiPlot":http://qtiplot.ro, "Labplot":http://labplot.sourceforge.net and
"Gnuplot":http://www.gnuplot.info/.

What sets SciDAVis apart from the above is its emphasis on providing a
friendly and open environment (in the software as well as the project)
for new and experienced users alike. Particularly, this means that we
will try to provide good documentation on all levels, ranging from
user's manual over tutorials down to and including
"documentation of the internal <a href="../contributing/API/index.html" target="_blank">APIs</a>
We encourage users to share their experiences on our "forums":https://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=199120
and on our "mailing lists":https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=199120.

h1. History

SciDAVis has been started as a fork off of "QtiPlot":http://qtiplot.ro with the aim of introducing some changes
in design as well as project structure.
The current code base - what will become SciDAVis 0.1.0 shortly - is very close to that of QtiPlot 0.9.x,
but we expect it to deviate considerably with our move towards a modular design and a less Origin-like interface
(see "roadmap":roadmap.html for details).
