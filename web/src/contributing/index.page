h1. Introduction

SciDAVis lives from your contributions. There's many ways in which you
can "contribute":contributing.html, and only one or two of them require any programming
knowledge. Depending on your skills and the amount of time you are
willing to invest, you can provide help on the forums, improve or write
documentation, report bugs, suggest features, translate SciDAVis into a
new language or update an existing translation, package SciDAVis for your
favorite distribution or platform, write new features, create artwork
(icons, splash screen, mascot), etc., etc.
