h1. What can you find here?

This page aims to give you an overview of where you can find help on using SciDAVis.
It does not contain help related to contributing to or developing SciDAVis, which
is "here":../contributing/index.html.

h1. The user's manual

[ coming soon ]

h1. The help forum

No manual can possibly answer all your questions. Maybe you can't find the right section to look
for your problem in the manual or something doesn't work like you'd expect it to but you're
not 100% sure it's a bug.
For these cases, the "Help & Tips":https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=708156
forum was established. Here, users can help each other with their problems.
Since we're using SciDAVis too, you can expect us to drop by now and then. :-)

h1. The user's mailing list

Some people prefer using email for discussions, so we're offering a
"user's mailing list":https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scidavis-users
where you can ask questions, share your insights and just discuss anything related to using SciDAVis.
By subscribing to this list, you also get the chance to learn from other people's questions and
discussions.

h1. Tutorials and example projects

In the future, we hope we can present you a list of user contributed tutorials, useful scripts, and
example projects here.
