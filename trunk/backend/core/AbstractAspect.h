//! Base class of all persistent objects in a Project.
/**
 * Before going into the details, it's useful to understand the ideas behind the
 * \ref aspect "Aspect Framework".
 *
 * Aspects organize themselves into trees, where a parent takes ownership of its children. Usually,
 * though not necessarily, a Project instance will sit at the root of the tree (without a Project
 * ancestor, project() will return 0 and undo does not work). Children are organized using
 * addChild(), removeChild(), child(), indexOfChild() and childCount() on the parent's side as well
 * as the equivalent convenience methods index() and remove() on the child's side.
 * In contrast to the similar feature of QObject, Aspect trees are fully undo/redo aware and provide
 * several signals and protected virtual notification methods around object adding/removal.
 *
 * AbstractAspect manages for every Aspect the properties #name, #comment, #caption_spec and
 * #creation_time. All of these translate into the caption() as described in the documentation
 * of setCaptionSpec().
 *
 * If an undoStack() can be found (usually it is managed by Project), changes to the properties
 * as well as adding/removing children support multi-level undo/redo. In order to support undo/redo
 * for problem-specific data in derived classes, make sure that all changes to your data are done
 * by handing appropriate commands to exec().
 *
 * Optionally,
 * you can supply an icon() to be used by different views (including the ProjectExplorer)
 * and/or reimplement createContextMenu() for a custom context menu of views.
 *
 * The private data of AbstractAspect is contained in a separate class AbstractAspect::Private.
 * The write access to AbstractAspect::Private should always be done using aspect commands
 * to allow undo/redo.
