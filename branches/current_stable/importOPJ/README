This directory contains EXPERIMENTAL Python code for parsing OPJ (Microcal Origin project) files
and converting them to SciDAVis projects. Only tables and notes are imported at the moment.

Contents:

opj2sciprj.py - An import script that can be run through "scidavis -x". It will pop up a dialog
                asking for an OPJ file to be imported and write the imported project to
				    file.opj.sciprj (where file.opj is the name of the file that is imported).

opjparse/*.py - Python module which parses OPJ files and stores the contents in a hierarchy of
                Python objects, which can be dumped to console, examined interactively or used to
					 extract/convert the contents by scripts like importOPJ.py.

COPYING       - A copy of the GPL 3 license. While SciDAVis itself is licensed under GPL2+, opjparse
                is GPL3+.

doc/*.txt     - Text files containing short summaries of various aspects of the OPJ format.
                Interesting if you try to understand and/or improve opjparse.
