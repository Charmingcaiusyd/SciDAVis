			<h1>Generic requirements</h1>
			<p>
			In order to compile SciDAVis, you need to install the following libraries:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html">Qt (>=4.2)</a>,</li>
				<li><a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/index.html">Qwt (>=5.0.0)</a>,</li>
				<li><a href="http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/">QwtPlot3D</a>,</li>
				<li><a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/">GSL</a>,</li>
				<li><a href="http://muparser.sourceforge.net">muParser</a> and</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>QwtPlot3D and Qwt must be compiled against Qt 4.x! If these are compiled with Qt3,
				the application will crash!</strong>
			See below for how to ensure this.
			</p><p>
			This version of SciDAVis uses a modified version of
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/liborigin/">liborigin</a> which is supplied in the "3rdparty" folder.
			It is already included in the scidavis/scidavis.pro file and does not need to be compiled or installed separately.
			</p>

			<h1>Linux / Mac OS X</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Install
				<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html">Qt (>=4.2)</a>,
				<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/">GSL</a>,
				<a href="http://muparser.sourceforge.net">muParser</a> and
				<a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>;
				either from your package manager or from the sources.
				If you are using precompiled packages, make sure you also install the corresponding development packages (*-dev or *-devel).
				If you want to display the manual from within SciDAVis (you can also view it with your favorite browser),
				you need to have the Qt Assistant installed, which sometimes comes in a separate package (qt4-dev-tools for Ubuntu edgy).</li>
				<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
				<li>Get <a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/index.html">Qwt (>=5.0.0)</a> sources and unpack them to the 3rdparty folder:<br>
				<code>cd scidavis-X.X.X/3rdparty<br>tar -xvjf /path/to/qwt-Y.Y.Y.tar.bz2</code></li>
				<li>Rename the new directory to <code>qwt</code>:<br>
				<code>mv qwt-Y.Y.Y qwt</code></li>
				<li>We want to build the static version of Qwt in order to avoid potential conflicts with an already installed version.
				Open the file qwt/qwtconfig.pri and comment out the line<br>
				<code>CONFIG += QwtDll</code></li>
				<li>Build Qwt:<br><code>cd qwt; qmake &amp;&amp; make; cd ..</code></li>
				<li>Get <a href="http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/">QwtPlot3D</a> sources and also unpack them to scidavis-X.X.X/3rdparty:<br>
				<code>tar -xvzf qwtplot3d-Z.Z.Z.tgz</code></li>
				<li>We also want to build a static version here, so open qwtplot3d/qwtplot3d.pro in your favorite text editor and add the line<br>
				<code>CONFIG += staticlib</code><br>
				at a convenient place (say, below the other CONFIG line).</li>
				<li>Build qwtplot3d:<br><code>cd qwtplot3d; qmake &amp;&amp; make; cd ..</code></li>
				<li>Go to the directory scidavis-X.X.X/scidavis:<br><code>cd ../scidavis</code></li>
				<li>If you want to use Python expressions and scripts, make sure you have the following additional dependencies installed:
				<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2.5,
				<a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip">SIP</a> 4.5.2 or 4.6,
				<a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt">PyQt</a> 4.2.
				Other versions as those indicated above may or may not work.
				Specifically, there are known issues with a number of SIP versions and
				a given version of PyQt will only work with a limited range of SIP
				versions.
				<br>
				Open scidavis.pro in a text editor and remove the comment marker (#) from the line <code>include( python.pri )</code>.
				</li>
				<li>Build SciDAVis:<br><code>qmake &amp;&amp; make</code></li>
				<li>You should now be able to run SciDAVis by entering<br><code>./scidavis</code></li>
				<li>Optionally, install SciDAVis on your system (you need root priviliges):<br>
				<code>sudo make install</code><br>or, alternatively,<br><code>su -c "make install"</code></li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Windows</h1>

			<p>
			This section needs some loving care.
			Maybe the above Linux / MacOS X list can be adapted to include all the quirks
			of the procedure necessary for Windows.
			Since we're mostly using Linux, someone more familiar with compilation on Windows
			would be very welcome to rewrite the instructions below and/or to provide pre-compiled binaries.
			</p>

			You need to install the
			<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows">Qt/Windows Open Source Edition</a> (&gt;= 4.2).
			and use the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> compiler.<br>
			<br>
			The compilation of SciDAVis from sources requires the following steps:<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Install or compile the required libraries listed above.</li>
				<li>Modify the 'scidavis/scidavis.pro' file with a text editor in order to set the INCLUDEPATH variables to the header files ('include' directory) of your local build of the libraries listed above. E.g. <code>INCLUDEPATH  += ../3rdparty/qwtplot3d/include</code> if you put QwtPlot3D into the "3rdparty" directory.<br>
				Remark: Lines stating with # are comments and thus ignored by qmake.</li>
				<li>Modify the 'scidavis/scidavis.pro' file to set the LIBS variables (those prefixed <code>win32:</code> only) to the actual directories of your library builds. E.g. <code>win32:LIBS += ../3rdparty/qwtplot3d/lib/libqwtplot3d.a</code> if you put QwtPlot3D (as a static library) into the "3rdparty" directory.</li>
				<li>Open a command prompt, go to the 'scidavis-X.X.X\scidavis' folder (<code>cd X:\path\to\scidavis\scidavis-X.X.X\scidavis</code>) and execute<br>
				<code>qmake scidavis.pro</code>.</li>
				<li>Finally type <code>mingw32-make</code> and wait until it finishes building scidavis.exe.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Additional information</h1>

			<h2>Forums and mailing lists:</h2>
			If you want to discuss SciDAVis with other users (or the developers) or if you are insterested
			in its further development, you can go to the
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=199120">SciDAVis forum</a> or subscribe to the
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=199120">SciDAVis mailing list</a>.

			Thus it is <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html">"free software"</a>.
			"Free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in
			"free speech", not as in "free beer".
			"Free software" is also often called
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software">Open Source, FOSS, or FLOSS</a>.
			When we say that SciDAVis is "free", we are talking about
			<ul>
				<li> The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
				<li> The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1).
				Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
				<li> The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>
				<li> The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
			</ul>
			That said, SciDAVis is also free as in "free beer".
			We do not charge money for anything you can download on our homepage and we will not do so in the future.
			See <a href="http://scidavis.sourceforge.net/contributing/index.html">here</a> for why
			we can do this and why we're working on SciDAVis.
