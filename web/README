This directory contains the source files for generating the SciDAVis homepage
using webgen (http://webgen.rubyforge.org). It uses Textile for the page descriptions,
so you'll also have to install RedCloth (http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth),
and it uses webgen's SyntaxHighlighter, which depends on coderay
(http://coderay.rubychan.de/).

If you have rubygems (http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems) installed, you can pull
in all required packages using gem install:

gem install webgen
gem install redcloth
gem install coderay

After that, all you have to do is run the command "webgen" from this directory.
This will produce a new subdirectory "output" containing the generated site.
