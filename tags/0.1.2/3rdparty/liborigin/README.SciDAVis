Except for this file, this directory contains unmodified 
copies of (the for SciDAVis relevant) files from the liborigin SVN 
repository exported with
"svn export https://liborigin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/liborigin/[filename]".

Last exported revision: 18 (Mon Jul 9 09:45:10 2007 UTC)

The purpose of distributing these files along with SciDAVis is to provide
a version that compiles cleanly with SciDAVis. Liborigin is still
in alpha stage after all and it is unsure whether the API will change
significantly from release to release.
