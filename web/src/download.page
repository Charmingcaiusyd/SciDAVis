The first release (SciDAVis 0.1.0) is roughly planned for the end of July, depending on
how long the changes detailled "here":about/roadmap.html#0.1.0 will take.
Since we're all working on this project in our spare time, it's a bit difficult to
give precise dates.

Until then, you can check out the development version using "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org.
Here's how to do it:

{hlblock: {blockName: svnco, highlight: plaintext}}

Instructions for compiling can be found in the file "README.html" included with the source.
